# Eigenstuff
A personal tool I used for my linear algebra class to calculate eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalize matrices.

NOTE: matrices in eigenstuf.clj are in the form [[a b] [c d]] where the inner square brackets denote rows and the outer brackets denote the entire square-matrix

Future plans:

 -Implment clojure source code into a web app or java app
 -Add complex number functionality to eigenstuff.clj with code in complex.clj
 -Improve user input and display
